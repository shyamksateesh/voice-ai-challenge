[00:00] You were just fine
[00:02] Did I make it that easy
[00:06] To walk right in and out
[00:10] Of my life
[00:16] Goodbye my almost lover
[00:20] Goodbye my hopeless dream
[00:24] I'm trying not to think about you
[00:26] And can't you just let me be
[00:30] So long my luckless romance
[00:34] My back is turned on you
[00:38] Should've known you'd bring me heartache
[00:43] Almost lovers always do
[00:58] If I knew the way to tell you
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59] 
[00:59]
