[00:00] You were just a fire
[00:03] To unmake it that easy
[00:05] To walk right in and out
[00:10] Of my life
[00:16] Goodbye my almost lover
[00:20] Goodbye my hopeless dream
[00:24] I'm trying not to think about you
[00:27] Can't you just let me be
[00:31] So long my luckless romance
[00:35] My back is turned on to you
[00:39] Should've known you'd bring me heartache
[00:43] Almost lovers always
[00:49] Do
[00:58] I'm trying not to think about you
